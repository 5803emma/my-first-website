# My First Website
Welcome to my first website!

This website was built as part of the learning material for Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.

You can check out the website [here](https://5803emma.github.io/my-first-website/) !

## Project Rationale

The reason for creating this website was to get familiar with development tools like Cloud9, Git & GitHub, and how to use them to write and manage code. The project displays an image and a link to the Wikipedia pages of the different technologies used in each of the three streams of the program

### Technology

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is hosted on GitHub.
